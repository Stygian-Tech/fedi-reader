## Requirements

- iOS 26.0+ / macOS 26.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Swift Version

The app targets **Swift 5.9+** (required for `@Observable`). The project uses **targeted** strict concurrency and `MainActor` as the default actor isolation.

We have not migrated to Swift 6. **Targeted concurrency is sufficient for now**: `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = targeted` plus `MainActor` default gives incremental concurrency safety without Swift 6’s **complete** strict concurrency mode. Moving to Swift 6 would require full strict concurrency (broader `Sendable` and isolation work across services and models); we’ve deferred that until we can prioritize it. We may revisit once tooling and migration paths are clearer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedi-reader/fedi-reader.git
cd fedi-reader
```

2. Open in Xcode:
```bash
open fedi-reader.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run on your device or simulator.

## Architecture

Fedi Reader uses Apple's modern **@Observable** pattern with service classes, avoiding traditional MVVM in favor of a flat, service-oriented structure where Views directly consume Observable services.

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `MastodonClient` | Core API client with OAuth 2.0 |
| `AuthService` | Authentication flow management |
| `TimelineService` | Timeline fetching & pagination |
| `LinkFilterService` | Filters posts to links only |
| `AttributionChecker` | Author metadata extraction |
| `ReadLaterManager` | Unified read-later interface |

## Configuration

### Read Later Services

Each read-later service requires authentication:

| Service | Authentication |
|---------|---------------|
| Pocket | Consumer key + OAuth |
| Instapaper | Username/password (xAuth) |
| Omnivore | API key |
| Readwise | Access token |
| Raindrop | OAuth or API token |

Configure services in **Profile → Read Later Services**.

### URL Scheme

Fedi Reader registers the `fedi-reader://` URL scheme for OAuth callbacks.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Swift Testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme fedi-reader -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

See [WARP.md](WARP.md) for more build/test commands (single-suite, UI-only, clean, etc.).

### Test Coverage

- `LinkFilterServiceTests` - Link filtering logic
- `HTMLParserTests` - HTML parsing and entity decoding
- `AttributionCheckerTests` - Author attribution
- `MastodonTypesTests` - API type encoding/decoding

## ActivityPub Best Practices

Fedi Reader follows ActivityPub and Mastodon API best practices:

- Respects `Cache-Control` headers
- Honors rate limits (`X-RateLimit-*` headers)
- Uses appropriate `Accept` headers for ActivityPub
- Handles federation delays gracefully
- Displays content warnings appropriately
- Proper User-Agent identification

## Privacy

- Credentials are stored securely in the system Keychain
- No analytics or tracking
- No data shared with third parties
- All API communication uses HTTPS
